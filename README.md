# Demos and sample programs for the Ulanzi TC-001 LED display

Here there are:
* Arduino programs that program the Ulanzi LED display directly. Text, scrolling text, graphics and animations are displayed. These are in the directories that start with "Ulanzi-Demo".
* Python scripts used to remotely control the Awtrix firmware for the Ulanzi TC-001. These are in the “Awtrix-Python-Demos” directory.
